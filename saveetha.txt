					Principal's Message			


 
      Dr. R. Ramesh. M.E., Ph.D.,
           Principal
 
 
Welcome to Saveetha Engineering College.
Saveetha Engineering College nurtures and grows young people who pass through its doors and corridors. We encourage and challenge our students to succeed to be the best they can be.
We provide a system of education where by a state of the art  technology would support a much wider array of content from a worldwide perspective that would take the children of today through such strategically planned experiences, that were drawn from any part of the world and measured up qualitatively as per world standards to prepare world citizens of tomorrow .
As Principal my role is to foster an exciting and invigorating learning environment, where students are at the forefront of teaching and learning. Our dedicated staff work and learn together in collegiate teams to maximise students potential by implementing highly effective teaching strategies and student support systems.
Parents and Caregivers are valued partners and are encouraged to be actively involved in the learning of their children.
In the words of Dalai Lama,
"When educating the minds of our youth, we must not forget to educate their hearts  We spare no efforts to make the educational experience of our students meaningful and relevant to the socio-economic needs of the times & to equip our youth to face the challenges of the future for leading the society from the front, while ensuring that at the same time they are enjoying their experience of learning.
We cannot always build the future for our youth, but we can build our youth for the future
And as the cliché goes, last but not the least, I expect all my young Saveetha'ians to focus on their cherished goals and strive hard to accomplish them transcending mediocrity and procrastination.
In browsing our site and observing our structures, policies and news, it is my hope you will get a general understanding of our college environment and the educational setting we provide. Should you wish for any further explanation and perhaps desire to see our team in action, please contact us and make an appointment to call in and see our college in action.

					Science and Humanities			


The Department of S&H was established in the year 2001.
Faculty:
The Department of Science and Humanities, with faculty strength today of 50 members from English, Maths, Physics and Chemistry is headed by Mrs.J.Joy Priscilla.
Department of English
Todays global requirement places English Communication skills on the top, as a critical and crucial factor in making the students employable. William Shakespeare, the world famous poet and dramatist said, Mend your speech lest it mar your fortune.Communication is the one primary factor so crucial to be successful in any sphere of life.The department of English, headed by Dr. Rosalia H Bonjour has a very strong, dedicated and qualified faculty to help students become better Orators and communicators by teaching them not only to gain control over their stage fear and gain confidence, but also master the four skills- LSRW (Listening, Speaking, Reading & Writing); The team also handles Pronunciation, Vocabulary enhancement, Error detection and correction and teaching grammar through interactive methods.The department owns an air conditioned, Communication Lab set up in 2007 as prescribed by Anna University, with the purpose of giving students the opportunity of improving their skills.  The Lab has two sections- English Lab and the Career Lab. The English Lab deals with cloze tests, Error Correction, Jumbled sentences, Reading Comprehension, all done online. The Career Lab focuses on the third year students, preparing them for Group Discussion, Oral Presentations, Resume writing and Mock Interviews. The lab is brought into use on a daily basis.The faculty of English, besides dealing with the first year students also trains the Pre final year students  for BEC- Business English Certificate from the University of Cambridge, UK, and Skill edge from ICTACT Academy of Tamilnadu. The students are also trained for Placement by the Department.
Department of Mathematics
For life, now or in the future, one should meet and master formulas or methods for calculating areas, perimeters and volumes, and understand formulas or computation methods needed for loans, pensions and investments, for shop keeping or buying and selling with mark-ups or markdowns. This understanding should go beyond using the formulas. Most people learn mathematics until circumstances force them to stop, or until the subject becomes too hard or they lose interest. The Department of Mathematics, led by Ms. J Joy Priscilla, along with her team of dedicated, experienced and well qualified staff members help students learn maths with less effort and greater interest.Mathematics differs from natural sciences. The physical theories in the sciences are tested by experiments, while mathematical statements are supported by proofs which may be verified objectively by mathematicians. If a certain statement is believed to be true by mathematicians (typically because special cases have been confirmed to some degree) but has neither been proven nor dis-proven, it is called a conjecture, as opposed to the ultimate goal: a theorem that is proven true. Physical theories may be expected to change whenever new information about our physical world is discovered. New ideas in Mathematics don't falsify old ones but rather are used to generalize what was known before to capture a broader range of phenomena.There are no Nobel Prizes awarded to mathematicians. The award that is generally viewed as having the highest prestige in Mathematics is the Fields Medal.
Department of Physics
Making every student significantly smarter  which means having a more accurate understanding of nature or of anything in it  this is the one aim to teaching and learning Physics. The Department of Physics, led by Dr. Enakshi Das and her team of talented faculty, provide the students with the opportunity to educate themselves with the various concepts in Physics what scientists have traditionally spent years of labour and study to understand. Experiments can sharpen students' powers of observation, stimulate the power of questioning, and help develop new understanding and vocabulary.The Department has a well equipped laboratory to help the students in enabling them to share their skills and experience of making experiments work in the classroom. The Department of Physics is recognised as a Research centre by Anna University and boasts of the maximum doctorates on roll.
Department of Chemistry
Chemistry is present everywhere in our daily life. But most of us do not recognize the real involvement of Chemistry in our lives. The Department, headed by Dr. K Marimuthu and his dedicated and qualified faculty, provide the students with the necessary insight they must have to learn the marvels of Chemistry. The faculty of Chemistry also handle Environmental Science that teaches todays generation the need to understand and help our environment to keep us healthy and preserve our mother earth for future generations.Laboratory work is an essential element in pupil learning which cannot be replaced by other approaches. The Department has a well equipped laboratory which provides a positive contribution to understanding Chemistry.

					Academic Life			


The Saveetha Engineering College has an excellent academic coordination methodology which has evolved over a period of more than 17 years and has been producing excellent results in terms of students pass percentage and university ranks.
The Teaching and Learning Method :
All academic information including daily lecture notes and important questions are updated on Website to be accessed by student from anywhere before they come to the class. As per the teaching and learning method, each of the departments focuses on continuous assessment of students throughout the semester and year through continuous internal accessment exams, assignments, model exams etc. The department continuously tracks the course coverage by the faculty, and plans for any extra classes to complete the portions in time. Students attendance and their marks in each are being updated daily in the college website for the parents view.
Supplementing the curriculum :
Each of the department organizes Guest Lectures by experts from industry and academia to address the students on the subjects to supplement the curriculum and also create awareness on the recent trends in the respective subject.
Feedback from Students :
The department collects the feedback from students on the respective faculty members of the courses to ensure that the students are comfortable with the teaching method and the faculty members. Any remedial action is taken in the teaching methods, if required.
Special coaching for weak students :
Weak students are identified during the above internal accessment exams, etc and given special coaching classes, special tests etc. Students who fail or do not perform well in the internal exams / model exams etc are counseled individually and the information is conveyed to the parents through personal contact over phone. Parents are requested and encouraged to visit the college and meet the HODs to discuss the wards performance.
Discipline of Students :
The College believes that discipline of an individual is the key aspect for success not only in studies but in any endeavor pursued by the individual. Discipline is enforced to students for regular attendance to college and attendance to classes which contribute to good academic results.
Expectations from the industry :
The experts from industry who employ the graduating engineers expect them to have the ability to apply science and technology, to synthesize all the theoretical knowledge gained, especially multi disciplinary knowledge and create a useful product. With the initial learning time of engineers joining industry increasing, the project work should be made effective to shorten the initial learning time of engineers joining the industry.
Project Excellence :
The College emphasizes to the students the importance of excelling in final year projects where students apply the knowledge gained over the under graduate program and develop and complete an engineering project as a team. This not only provides a good insight into the knowledge gained but also develops soft skills of the students and prepares them well for job in the industry or higher studies.
So subsequent to the syllabus, the Saveetha Engineering College has taken steps to improve the quality of student projects by
 Encouraging and facilitating more in-house projects to be done by students in the campus facilities under the guidance of faculty members   Encouraging and facilitating students to do projects for specific organizations (eg ICF, NIOT) leading to the use of completed projects to be used by the organizations for a larger social cause   Installing the completed projects in the Saveetha Engineering College Labs for possible further work by next set of students and demonstration to visitors   Encouraging and facilitating the students to apply for patents, publish papers in national and international conferences and journals on the projects completed   Awarding the best student project to one batch in each branch in the subsequent Annual Day

Report  on International conference
The International Conference on Emerging Trends in Managing Disaster for Sustainability went on well on Dec 16th and 17th in EEE Seminar Hall. The event was split into 4 sections. The First section was Inaugural session on 16/12/2016 where Chief Guest address was given by Mr.Mohan raj-  MD, Diamond Groups and Key note address given by Dr. Voon Boo Ho from Universiti Teknologi MARA Sarawk, Kota Samarahan, Malaysia. Conference papers were published in Pezzottaite International journal. Journal was released by the two guests.


 
The Second section was Technical session I, and we had few presenters from University of Madras, Rajeev Gandhi National Institute and some Engineering Colleges. The session was conducted as per our schedule. 
On 17/12/2016 we had Technical Session II in the morning. Dr. Cha. Bala Nageshvara Rao, Director, SSM was the Session Chair and delivered his address. We had 10 presenters from different Colleges. In the afternoon we had Valedictory and our Principal distributed the Certificates to all. 

At the outset I thank our management for their support to organize the International conference in our campus. Conference went on successfully for which I thank our Director for giving us words of encouragement. 
I take pleasure in informing that our faculty members motivated our MBA Students to send papers and present them in Conference, which was an eye opener for our students.
I am happy to reveal that we received 56 papers from different colleges, Corporate and from abroad also. The number of papers mobilized by our faculty members are:
In spite of cyclone and other disaster in our State, our Conference was organized without much disturbances.
The journal with impact factor was also released on Conference day

It consists of text and reference books in different disciplines.     It has Books in the areas of Basic Electronics, Instrumentation , Process control, Measurements, Sensors Transducers, Control Systems, Analog and Digital Electronics, VLSI Design, Neural Networks, Fuzzy, Microprocessor etc and managerial books are also available to develop the student's aptitude, verbal and personality development skills.     All the B.E and project work reports are available for the students reference.
LABORATORY FACILITIES
PROCESS CONTROL LAB
     Process control lab enhances the students ability and provides a real time experience as in the process industries.     The students are studying the characteristics of various process control loops such as temperature, liquid level, flow and pressure systems.     The effect of various control actions for a particular process is being observed and an optimum controller setting is determined using different control algorithms.    From this lab, the students benefitted by learning mathematical modelling of various processes and obtaining the tuning parameters to control the process     They learn to control the major physical processes using scaled down replicas of the process plants. The systems can be controlled by the Digital PID controller and Computer.     Process control lab gives a close light on process like flow, level, temperature and pressure. It enables the students to gain a vivid and comprehensive practical knowledge about the industrial requirements.     They also learn to use various virtual simulation platforms such as mat lab, scada, labview etc., for the mathematically model the various processes.
    In control of process laboratory, the students are explained with the concept of controlling different continuous /discrete process, using computers.     The complex control system is simulated using MATLAB package.     The students are given ample training to draw ladder logic diagram for a given sequence of operations thereby converting it into PLCs program format and the corresponding simulation/real time results are observed.
INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM DESIGN LABORATORY 

     This lab is well furnished with good quality equipments like, Function generators, Digital Storage Oscilloscopes, CROs etc.     This lab covers the experiments related to Operational Amplifier and its applications     This laboratory aims to give learners an understanding of electronic devices and the skills needed to simulate, construct and test a variety of electronic circuits.    Electronics devices are used in a huge variety of manufactured products. From everyday popular items such as cameras and thermometers to the robotic welding machines used in industry, the use of electronics is continually growing.
    This Lab provides a practical introduction to basic electronic devices , analog/digital electronic principles.     It provides learners with an opportunity to investigate operation of the most important building components of electronic circuits, viz. diodes and transistors.     The overall aim is to build learners confidence in their ability to construct and test simple electronic circuits.     The emphasis is on prototyping, constructing and measuring electronic circuits. The unit treats systems in terms of their functionality and their input/output relationships.     Students gain knowledge of designing and building electronic circuits.    It helps them to gain hands on experience in debugging and testing circuits and in depth knowledge in using analog and digital circuits.
VIRTUAL INSTRUMENTATION LABORATORY

    Department of Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering are more fortunate to have a sophisticated VI laboratory.    The lab is fully air conditioned and can accommodate thirty students per session.     The lab is equipped with more than ten PCs and some were installed with licensed version of LabVIEW 2010. The special features of the latest version of LabVIEW include NxT Robotics and RF communication.     A couple of robots are available for experimentation purpose. One robot is a "pick and place" type which can be programmed to sense metal explosives and can be implemented for bomb disposal.     Other one has a couple of brushes which act like wipers and hence can be used for cleaning purpose.    PCs are supported by Intel® core processor and Windows XP Professional OS.DAQ signal accessories and  NI ELVIS have been bought from National Instruments which enable to generate and acquire signals from real world. Five  DAQ cards of four different specifications namely PCI 6221, PCI 6013, PCI1171 (add-on card) and PCI 6251 are being used     There are communication devices like EPM shielded cable and signal connector board in this lab.
INDUSTRIAL INSTRUMENTATION LABORATORY
 
    Industrial Instrumentation lab is basically concerned with the calibration of various primary sensing devices and measurement of various non-electrical parameters such as temperature, torque, viscosity, PH and conductivity etc     Also the students are trained to analyse various process fluid parameters using UV spectrophotometer.

Watt Club

WATT CLUB - Every Watt Counts
The Watt Club provides a forum, where students, alumni, faculty and industry professionals can come together for interaction, discussion and exchange of innovative ideas, to provide solutions to the possible energy crisis in future. Objective of this club is to promote consciousness and awareness among students about energy scarcity, measures to conserve energy and environment, ways to promote renewable energy, issues of sustainable development.
 The Watt Club was inaugurated on 5th February, 2013 in the presence of all the dignitaries with the lighting of kuthuvillaku at Nalli Arangam. The chief guest, Col.A.K.Vasudevan (joint controller, controllerate of quality assurance, Ministry of defence ) has given the inaugural address and the Guest of Honour, Mr.Rangaraju Kidambi,CEO of Developer Mark Technologies has delivered a guest lecture on Recent trends in Solar PV system. Dr.M.Singaaravelu, the Head of EEE Department welcomed the gathering. Prof.R.Dheenadayalu, the Dean, honored the guests and addressed the students on the occasion. Ms.K.Kanchana AP (SG)/EEE proposed the vote of thanks.
 The Website of Watt Club (www.wattclub.saveetha.ac.in) is designed by the students was launched by Mr.Rangaraju Kidambi.. The Car Manufacturing giant, FORD, has given a FORD FIGO car for the students of Electrical and Electronics Engineering to do research projects out of it. The key of the Car was handed over to the members of the Watt Club by Dr.M.Singaaravelu who suggested it to run using renewable hybrid technologies (solar power and fuel cell).
The students of Electrical and Electronics engineering have made a solar car. Watt Club has awarded a cash prize of Rs.5000/- for these students in order to motivate them. Prizes were awarded to the students for Logo Design, Website Design and innovative ideas by the dignitaries.
 Inauguration of Watt Club on 5th February, 2013 in the presence of Col.A.K.Vasudevan (joint controller, controllerate of quality assurance, Ministry of defence ), Mr.Rangaraju Kidambi(CEO of Developer Mark Technologies), Prof.R.Dheenadayalu(Dean),Dr.M.Singaaravelu(HOD EEE Department) and Dr.R.Senthil Kumar.

 REPORT ON 1.5 kW SOLAR POWER PROJECT
Motivation
In recent years, extensive use of electrical equipment has imposed severe demands for electrical energy, and this trend is constantly growing. Consequently, researchers and governments worldwide have made efforts on renewable energy applications for mitigating natural energy consumption and environmental concerns. Among various renewable energy sources, the solar energy has been considered attractive choice. This motivated us to do a project on the Implementation of solar system in our campus.
About the Project
Thus the interested EEE Students (Watt Club members) have done a project on Design and Implementation of Solar PV system of 1500 Watts. This renewable generating system is successfully implemented on the roof of Saveetha Engineering College front portico in the 3rd week of April 2013. 1200 Watts of load in the Central Library is now connected to the system for testing purpose and it is working successfully till the day. The generated electrical power is taken through the charge controller circuit to the batteries and the output of the batteries are connected to an inverter from were supply is given to our college library. An Energy meter is fixed for measuring the total energy consumed from solar power.

The programs are implemented using C++ or C language.
Object Oriented Programming LabThe major motivating factor in the invention of Object Oriented approach is to remove difficulties encountered in the procedural approach. It ties data more closely to the functions that operate on it and protects it from modification of outside function. Functions of one object can be accessed by the functions of other object. Windows platform is used to implement static members and methods, friend function, operator overloading, dynamic memory allocation, copy constructor, assignment operator overloading, destructor, linked list, sorting techniques, exception handling and prims algorithm using C++.
Data Structures LabFor Data Structure lab students developed codes in C language and Turbo C software in Windows operating systems. Students implemented the theory concepts of Data Structure such as Linked list, Stack, Queue, Trees, Sorting in lab as Programming codes .These concepts helps the students to develop many projects.
Operating Systems LabOperating Systems are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly, a course on Operating Systems is an essential part of any computer science education. This field is undergoing change at a breathtakingly rapid rate, as computer are now prevalent in virtually every application, from games for children through the most sophisticated planning tools for governments and multinational firms. UNIX platform was used to implement system calls, I/O system calls, UNIX commands, process scheduling, inter process communication, semaphore, memory management and file allocation using high level language C.
2. INTERNET PROGRAMMING LAB

These softwares are utilized by the students for their programming laboratories such as Internet programming Lab, Networks lab, Computer Graphics Lab.VMware player provides virtual environment to this lab. The Programming language lab is fully air conditioned with adequate centralized UPS backup. This lab specializes in internet technologies and database requirements needed for web designing and launching of the portals designed by the students. This lab specializes in systems engineering and testing of the networks and their simulations testing the quality of the models established.
Practical Courses Conducted:
Networks LabNetwork Lab uses NS2 simulator and Telnet(C Program). Telnet enables each user to easily type programs and which are saved at the server side. Networking concepts and protocols are implemented in telnet program. It is used for studying data transmission along with data rates, collision, congestion etc. Simulation software like NS2 is used. It enables us to build a network that enables us to view data transmissions and efficiency.
Internet Programming LabInternet Programming Lab enables students to design web pages using HTML elements and Cascading Style sheets. This describes the presentation semantics of a document written in a markup language. Helps students to know more about JavaScript programming because in most of web browsers Java script programs are used to interact with documents contained with it.
Computer GraphicsFundamental algorithms for the representation and display of two dimensional and three dimensional graphics objects are presented here. And different methods were examined for producing basic picture components and techniques for adjusting size, color and other objects attributes. This introduces students to the programming techniques necessary for implementing graphics routines .Programming examples were written in C and features of graphics libraries, OPENGL functions are used to demonstrate the implementation and applications of the graphics algorithms.
3. PG LAB


PG Lab provides knowledge in Hardware, Networking, Open source environment, middleware technologies, Computer graphics, Object oriented concepts and Java, etc., to the students and it promotes them to develop the software and applications in a most efficient manner. These labs are well equipped with the latest HP computers Intel Pentium CPU G630 @2.70 GHz, servers with high speed internet connectivity. Guidance is provided to the students by a team of experienced faculty members and lab technicians. This lab is equipped with Windows 7 OS, CISCO Packet Tracer, Turbo C/ C++,Fedora, Ecllipse IDE, Minix, Weenix, E-cos, Rational Rose. We have a total of 51 systems in this lab.
Practical Courses Conducted:
Object Oriented Analysis and Design LabThe main purpose of OOAD Lab is to divide a large project in to small modules and representing then using various diagrams. The diagram can be generated by using UML (Unified Modeling Language). It includes various diagrams like Use-case diagram, Activity etc. UML is a visual language for specifying, constructing and documenting the artifact of a system. The applications such as ATM system, E-Book system, Library Management System have been represented using UML diagrams. For diagrammatic representation, rational rose enterprise edition software is used. For implementation, Visual Basic is used.
Java LabJava Lab enables students to get familiar with Java and OOPs Concept. In this lab inheritance and polymorphism concepts are used to create new classes that are built on existing classes. Interfaces and packages are used for Graphical programming to design forms. Multithreading concepts are used for improving processor performance by executing more threads simultaneously.
